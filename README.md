# Neural-Networks-2022

This repository contains files from the 2023 Neural Networks course of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The course has 3 main projects. 

# Intermediate Assignment 
Predicts the labels of images from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database using the k nearest neighbor classifier function of the sklearn library and the nearest centroid classifier functiom of the sklearn library.

# Project 1- MLP 
In this project a Multi-Layer perceptron was created from scratch. The neural network was trained using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database and the goal was to predict the labels from images depicting handwritten digits.

# Project 2- SVM 
In the second project the goal was again to predict the labels of images from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database. In this case we used the SVC function of the sklearn library.

# Project 3- RBF
In this project an RBF neural network was created from scratch. The neural network was trained using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database and the goal was to predict the labels from images depicting handwritten digits.
